Intrinsically Disordered Proteins using Flows (IDP Flows)
========================================

IDP Flows is a research study for investigating the use of normalizing flows to do conformer prediction on intrinsically disordered proteins. This work is based on the work from DeepMind [Normalizing flows for atomic solids](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ac6b16/pdf)
